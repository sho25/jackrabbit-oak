comment|/**  *<pre>  * Module: Authorization (Permission Evaluation)  * =============================================================================  *  * Title: Representation of Permissions in the Repository  * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  *  * Goal:  * Understand how the default implementation represents permissions in the repository.  * This advanced exercise aims to provide you with some insights to the permission  * store and how permissions are being evaluated from the content stored  * therein.  *  * Exercises:  *  * - Overview  *   Look {@code org/apache/jackrabbit/oak/plugins/nodetype/write/builtin_nodetypes.cnd}  *   and try to identify the built in node types used to store permission  *   content.  *  *   Question: Can explain the meaning of all types?  *   Question: Why are most item definitions protected?  *   Question: Can you identify node types that are not used? Can you explain why?  *  * - {@link #testAdministrativeAccessOnly()}  *   The permission store is hidden from regular users and can only be  *   accessed using an administrative session. Use to test to find out how this  *   is enforced by the implementation.  *  *   Question: Can you imagine why the permission store should only be accessible  *   to administrative sessions?  *   Question: Can you identify the class(es) that actually enforce this?  *   Question: Can you explain why the permission store is not 'hidden' like the  *   index content? Compare these different approaches and discuss your findings.  *  * - {@link #testReadOnly()}  *   The permission store is a system maintained structure and cannot be edited  *   using JCR or Oak API calls. This test aims to illustrate this behavior.  *  *   Question: Can you explain why the permission store is read-only?  *   Question: Can you identify the class(es) responsible for enforcing the read-only nature?  *  * - {@link #TODO}  *  *</pre>  */
