differences regarding jackrabbit 2.x implementation
================================================================================

- privileges stored in repository content
- PrivilegeManager used for JCR Access Control API but not for internal
  permission evaluation (-> delegated to oak-core)


TODO:
================================================================================

- PrivilegeManager#registerPrivilege
  missing implementation (still struggling with oak-api. what we need here
  was the ability to add multiple items at once without the jcr-layer being able
  to retrieve those items before they are being persisted)....

- Privilege#getAggregates
  since the privilege manager cannot really rely on proper validation,
  it should make sure no circular aggregation has been introduced in a
  deeper level).

- Namespace handling on session level

- Path/Name/NodeTypes handling that rely on oak-core implementation
