It may also      * (or just) contain so-called "pseudo-properties" such as "jcr:score" and      * "rep:excerpt", in case the index supports those properties and if the      * properties were requested when running the query. The query engine will      * indicate that those pseudo properties were requested by setting an      * appropriate (possibly unrestricted) filter condition.      *<p>      * The index should return a row with those properties that are stored in      * the index itself, so that the query engine doesn't have to load the whole      * row / node unnecessarily (avoiding to load the whole row is sometimes      * called "index only scan"), specially for rows that are anyway skipped. If      * the index does not have an (efficient) way to return some (or any) of the      * properties, it doesn't have to provide those values. In this case, the      * query engine will load the node itself if required. If all conditions      * match, the query engine will sometimes load the node to do access checks,      * but this is not always the case, and it is not the case if any of the      * (join) conditions do not match.      *       * @return the row      */
