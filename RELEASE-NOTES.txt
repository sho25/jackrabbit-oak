Release Notes -- Apache Jackrabbit Oak -- Version 1.3.4

Introduction
------------

Jackrabbit Oak is a scalable, high-performance hierarchical content
repository designed for use as the foundation of modern world-class
web sites and other demanding content applications.

Apache Jackrabbit Oak 1.3.4 is an unstable release cut directly from
Jackrabbit Oak trunk, with a focus on new features and other
improvements. For production use we recommend the latest stable 1.2.x
release.

The Oak effort is a part of the Apache Jackrabbit project.
Apache Jackrabbit is a project of the Apache Software Foundation.

New configuration options in Oak 1.3.4
--------------------------------------

For DocumentNodeStore based deployments a new check has been introduced which compares 
oak-local clocks with the one from the DocumentStore-server. If the clocks are off by more 
than a certain amount, the DocumentNodeStore will refuse to start. Details see OAK-2682.
The default of 2000ms can be changed via -Doak.documentMK.maxServerTimeDiffMillis
