### Permission Evaluation : Differences wrt Jackrabbit 2.x

*NOTE: Work in Progress*

Refer to [OAK-942](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-942) for a general overview of changes
with respect to Jackrabbit 2.

* As of Oak `Node#remove()` only requires sufficient permissions to remove the target node. In
  contrast to jackrabbit the validation will not traverse the tree and verify remove permission on
  all child nodes/properties. There exists a configuration flag that aims to produce best effort
  backwards compatibility but this flag is currently not enabled by default. Please let us know if
  you suspect this causes wrong behavior in your application.

* By default user management operations require the specific user mgt related
  permission that has been introduced with OAK-1.0. This behavior can be
  turned off by setting the corresponding configuration flag.

* As of OAK reading and writing items in the version store does not follow the
  regular permission evaluation but depends on access rights present on the
  corresponding versionable node [OAK-444](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OAK-444).
