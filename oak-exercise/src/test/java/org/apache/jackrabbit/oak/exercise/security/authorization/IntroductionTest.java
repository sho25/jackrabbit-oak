comment|/**  *<pre>  * Module: Authorization  * =============================================================================  *  * Title: Introduction to Authorization  * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  *  * Goal:  * Get a basic understanding how authorization is organized in Oak and become  * familiar with distiction between access control management and permission  * evaluation.  *  * Exercises:  *  * - Read JCR Specification and the Oak Documentation with focus on authorization  *   and the distiction between access control management and permission  *   evaluation.  *  *   Question: Can you explain the difference between access control management and permission evaluation?  *  * - Overview  *   Take a look at the package structure in {@code org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.spi.security.authorization}  *   and {@code org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.security.authorization} and try to  *   become familiar with the interfaces and classes defined therein.  *   Look for usages of the key entry points ({@link AccessControlManager} and  *   {@link PermissionProvider} and try to get a big picture.  *  *   Question: Can you identify this distinction when looking at {@link AuthorizationConfiguration}?  *   Question: What can you say about the usage of {@link AccessControlManager} in oak-core and oak-jcr?  *   Question: What can you say about the usage of {@link PermissionProvider} in oak-core and oak-jcr?  *  * - Configuration  *   Look at the default implementation of the {@link AuthorizationConfiguration}  *   and try to identify the configurable parts. Compare your results with the  *   Oak documentation.  *  *   Question: Can you provide a separate list for access control management and permission options?  *   Question: Are the configuration options that affect both parts?  *  * - Pluggability  *   Starting from the {@link AuthorizationConfiguration} again, investigate  *   how the default implementation could be replaced.  *  *   Question: Is it possible to combine different authorization implementations?  *  *</pre>  */
