comment|/**  * The {@code RestrictionDefinition} interface provides methods for  * discovering the static definition of any additional policy-internal refinements  * of the access control definitions. These restrictions are intended to be  * used wherever effects are too fine-grained to be exposed through privilege  * discovery or define a different restriction mechanism. A common case may be  * to provide finer-grained access restrictions to individual properties or  * child nodes of the node to which the policy applies e.g. by means of  * naming patterns or node type restrictions.  *  * Its subclass {@code Restriction} adds methods that are relevant only when  * a given restriction is "live" after being created and applied to a given  * policy.  *  * @see org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.JackrabbitAccessControlList#getRestrictionNames()  * @see org.apache.jackrabbit.api.security.JackrabbitAccessControlList#getRestrictionType(String)  */
