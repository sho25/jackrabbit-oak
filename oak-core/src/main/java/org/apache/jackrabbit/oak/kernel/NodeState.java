This interface  * represents a specific, immutable state of a node in a content tree.  * A node consists of an unordered set of name -&gt; item mappings, where  * each item is either a property or a child node.  *<p>  * Depending on context, a NodeState instance can be interpreted as  * representing the state of just that node, of the subtree starting at  * that node, or of an entire tree in case it's a root node.  *<p>  * The crucial difference between this interface and the similarly named  * class in Jackrabbit 2.x is that this interface represents a specific,  * immutable state of a node, whereas the Jackrabbit 2.x class represented  * the<em>current</em> state of a node.  *  *<h2>Immutability and thread-safety</h2>  *<p>  * As mentioned above, all node and property states are always immutable.  * Thus repeating a method call is always guaranteed to produce the same  * result as before unless some internal error occurs (see below). This  * immutability only applies to a specific state instance. Different states  * of a node can obviously be different, and in some cases even different  * instances of the same state may behave slightly differently. For example  * due to performance optimization or other similar changes the iteration  * order of properties or child nodes may be different for two instances  * of the same state.  *<p>  * In addition to being immutable, a specific state instance guaranteed to  * be fully thread-safe. Possible caching or other internal changes need to  * be properly synchronized so that any number of concurrent clients can  * safely access a state instance.  *  *<h2>Persistence and error-handling</h2>  *<p>  * A node state can be (and often is) backed by local files or network  * resources. All IO operations or related concerns like caching should be  * handled transparently below this interface. Potential IO problems and  * recovery attempts like retrying a timed-out network access need to be  * handled below this interface, and only hard errors should be thrown up  * as {@link RuntimeException unchecked exceptions} that higher level code  * is not expected to be able to recover from.  *<p>  * Since this interface exposes no higher level constructs like access  * controls, locking, node types or even path parsing, there's no way  * for content access to fail because of such concerns. Such functionality  * and related checked exceptions or other control flow constructs should  * be implemented on a higher level above this interface.  *  *<h2>Decoration and virtual content</h2>  *<p>  * Not all content exposed by this interface needs to be backed by actual  * persisted data. An implementation may want to provide derived data,  * like for example the aggregate size of the entire subtree as an  * extra virtual property. A virtualization, sharding or caching layer  * could provide a composite view over multiple underlying content trees.  * Or a basic access control layer could decide to hide certain content  * based on specific rules. All such features need to be implemented  * according to the API contract of this interface. A separate higher level  * interface needs to be used if an implementation can't for example  * guarantee immutability of exposed content as discussed above.  *  *<h2>Equality and hash codes</h2>  *<p>  * Two node states are considered equal if and only if their properties and  * child nodes match, regardless of ordering. The  * {@link Object#equals(Object)} method needs to be implemented so that it  * complies with this definition. And while node states are not meant for  * use as hash keys, the {@link Object#hashCode()} method should still be  * implemented according to this equality contract.  */
