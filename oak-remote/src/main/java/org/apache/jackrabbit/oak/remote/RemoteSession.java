comment|/**  * Collection of operations available on a remote repository once the user  * correctly logged in.  *<p>  * Operations working on pure content, like reading a tree or committing  * changes, requires a revision. A revision represents a snapshot of the  * repository in a specified point in time. This concept enables repeatable  * reads and consistent writes.  *<p>  * When binary data is involved, this interface exposes methods to read and  * write arbitrary binary data from and to the repository. A binary data is  * considered an immutable collection of bytes that can be referenced by an  * identifier.  */
