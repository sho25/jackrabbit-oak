differences regarding jackrabbit 2.x implementation
================================================================================

General:
- user management always associated with editing Session
- changes made to user-mgt API are always transient + require Session#save()
- in case of failure Session#refresh is not called anymore

Unsupported Operations:
- UserManager#autoSave(boolean)
- User#getCredentials()

UserManager:
- UserManager#isAutoSave() always returns false
- password not mandatory upon creation (TODO: check again)
- no groupID generation for UserManager#createGroup(Principal) as alternative createGroup methods with ID param exist

Authorizable:
- setProperty, removeProperty executes no extra shortcut check for protected properties
- not relying on rep:principalName to exist -> using ID as fallback
-

User:

Group:


TODO:
================================================================================

- Path handling that rely on oak-core implementation

- Configuration based on oak-core implementation
