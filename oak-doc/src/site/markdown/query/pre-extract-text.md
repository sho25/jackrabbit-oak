# Pre-Extracting Text from Binaries

`@since Oak 1.0.18, 1.2.3`

Lucene indexing is performed in a single threaded mode. 
Extracting text from binaries is an expensive operation and slows down the indexing rate considerably.
For incremental indexing this mostly works fine but if performing a reindex or creating the index for the first time after 
migration then it increases the indexing time considerably. 
To speed up such cases Oak supports pre extracting text from binaries to avoid extracting text at indexing time. 
This feature consist of 2 broad steps 

1. Extract and store the extracted text from binaries using oak-run tooling.
2. Configure Oak runtime to use the extracted text at time of indexing via `PreExtractedTextProvider`

For more details on this feature refer to [OAK-2892][OAK-2892]

## A - Oak Run Pre-Extraction Command

Oak run tool provides a `tika` command which supports traversing the repository and then extracting text from the 
binary properties. 

### Step 1 - oak-run Setup

Download following jars

* oak-run 1.7.2 

Refer to [oak-run setup](../features/oak-run-nodestore-connection-options.md) for details about connecting to different 
types of NodeStore. Example below assume a setup consisting of SegmentNodeStore and FileDataStore. Depending on setup
use the appropriate connection options.

You can use current oak-run version to perform text extraction for older Oak setups i.e. its fine to use oak-run
from 1.7.x branch to connect to Oak repositories from version 1.0.x or later. The oak-run tooling connects to the 
repository in read only mode and hence safe to use with older version.

The generated extracted text dir can then be used with older setup.

### Step 2 - Generate the csv file

As the first step you would need to generate a csv file which would contain details about the binary property.
This file would be generated by using the `tika` command from oak-run. In this step oak-run would connect to 
repository in read only mode. 

To generate the csv file use the `--generate` action

        java -jar oak-run.jar tika \
        --fds-path /path/to/datastore \
        --nodestore /path/to/segmentstore --data-file oak-binary-stats.csv --generate

If connecting to S3 this command can take long time because checking binary id currently triggers download of the 
actual binary content which we do not require. To speed up here we can use the Fake DataStore support of oak-run

        java -jar oak-run.jar tika \
        --fake-ds-path=temp \
        --nodestore /path/to/segmentstore --data-file oak-binary-stats.csv --generate
        
This would generate a csv file with content like below

```
43844ed22d640a114134e5a25550244e8836c00c#28705,28705,"application/octet-stream",,"/content/activities/jcr:content/folderThumbnail/jcr:content"
43844ed22d640a114134e5a25550244e8836c00c#28705,28705,"application/octet-stream",,"/content/snowboarding/jcr:content/folderThumbnail/jcr:content"
...
```

### Step 3 - Perform the text extraction

Once the csv file is generated we need to perform the text extraction. To do that we would need to download the 
[tika-app](https://tika.apache.org/download.html) jar from Tika downloads. You should be able to use 1.15 version
with Oak 1.7.2 jar.

To perform the text extraction use the `--extract` action

        java -cp tika-app-1.15.jar:oak-run.jar \
        org.apache.jackrabbit.oak.run.Main tika \
        --data-file binary-stats.csv \
        --store-path ./store  \
        --fds-path /path/to/datastore  extract
        
This command does not require access to NodeStore and only requires access to the BlobStore. So configure
the BlobStore which is in use like FileDataStore or S3DataStore. Above command would do text extraction
using multiple threads and store the extracted text in directory specified by `--store-path`. 

Currently extracted text files are stored as files per blob in a format which is same one used with `FileDataStore`

Note that we need to launch the command with `-cp` instead of `-jar` as we need to include classes outside of oak-run jar 
like tika-app

## B - PreExtractedTextProvider

In this step we would configure Oak to make use of the pre extracted text for the indexing. Depending on how 
indexing is being performed you would configure the `PreExtractedTextProvider` either in OSGi or in oak-run index command

### Oak application

`@since Oak 1.0.18, 1.2.3`

For this look for OSGi config for `Apache Jackrabbit Oak DataStore PreExtractedTextProvider`
        
    ![OSGi Configuration](pre-extracted-text-osgi.png)   
   
Once `PreExtractedTextProvider` is configured then upon reindexing Lucene
indexer would make use of it to check if text needs to be extracted or not. Check
`TextExtractionStatsMBean` for various statistics around text extraction and also
to validate if `PreExtractedTextProvider` is being used.

### Oak Run Indexing

Configure the directory storing pre extracted text via `--pre-extracted-text-dir` option in `index` command.
